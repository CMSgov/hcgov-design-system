# Publishing a new release

## 1) Publish to NPM

Run `yarn release` to build a release from the HEAD of the master branch and publish it to NPM. The pre-publish script will prompt you for the version number change. 

**Note:** You must be logged in to an NPM account with publishing rights on the `cmsgov` organization for this to work. To request access, create a [Jira ticket on the QPP Tools and Access board](https://jira.cms.gov/browse/QTA-847) with your EUA and NPM username. Reach out on the [`#hcgov-design-system` channel](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C0111BVM1LZ) for any questions on this process.

## 2) Update the documentation site

Run `yarn gh-pages` to build and deploy the documentation site.

1. For the tag, use the format `v*` (ie. `v1.1.0`)

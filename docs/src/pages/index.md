The [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) design system is a set of open-source design and front-end development resources for creating usable, accessible (e.g., WCAG/Section 508 compliant), responsive, and consistent websites and web-based solutions.

The Healthcare.gov design system is built on the CMS Design System and extends it to support additional CSS and React components.

The design system is currently being applied to some pages on HealthCare.gov and project teams are actively working to apply the design system consistently across all of HealthCare.gov. 

**Applications and websites using the Healthcare.gov design system**

## Getting started

### Developers

Developers and engineers are encouraged to use React which allows for more complex, interactive components, and many of our React components have built-in accessibility optimizations.

* **Recommended option:** Install the `@cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov` Node package manager (npm) package if your project uses npm for package management.

### Designers

Design teams using are currently using Figma for creating UIs that follow HealthCare.gov's Design System but will be transitioning to using Sketch in the future.

The [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) design system is a set of open-source design and front-end development resources for creating usable, accessible (e.g., WCAG/Section 508 compliant), responsive, and consistent websites and web-based solutions.

A design system like this allows webpages and web-based tools to leverage components that function and appear consistent across HealthCare.gov. Product teams can use the design system to quickly prototype and build usable, accessible, responsive, and production-ready web-based solutions.

The Healthcare.gov design system is built on the CMS Design System and extends it to support additional CSS and React components.

The design system is currently being applied to some pages on HealthCare.gov and project teams are actively working to apply the design system consistently across all of HealthCare.gov. Check out some examples of pages using the design system.

* [Find Local Help](https://localhelp.healthcare.gov/#/)
* [Tax Tools](https://www.healthcare.gov/tax-tool/#/)
* [Window Shop](https://healthcare.gov/see-plans)

The design system is open-source, which means it's freely available to use by anyone!

## Getting started

### Developers

Developers and engineers are encouraged to use React which allows for more complex, interactive components, and many of our React components have built-in accessibility optimizations.

* **Recommended option:** Install the `@cmsgov/ds-healthcare-gov` Node package manager (npm) package if your project uses npm for package management.

* If you're unfamiliar with npm and package management, [download the code as a zip file](https://github.com/CMSgov/design-system/releases/latest). 

### Designers

Design teams at CMS typically uses Sketch as the preferred user interface (UI) design tool. Take advantage of these resources when you're creating UIs that follow HealthCare.gov's Design System.

* **Recommended option:** Install the HealthCare.gov Sketch library so we'll automatically receives updates when new versions of the Sketch Library are released by the HealthCare.gov team.

    Install HealthCare.gov Sketch library (coming soon)
